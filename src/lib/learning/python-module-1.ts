# Python Foundations
Welcome to your guided engineering journey. Instead of parsing textbook chapters, we will learn Python by engineering a real-world system: the **Tech Tomorrow Student Portal CLI**. Over this course, you will write the interpreter scripts, compute grading stats, and manage user connection sessions.

---

# CONCEPT EXPLANATION
## Top-To-Bottom Execution
When you run a Python file, the system reads your instructions like a human reads a book: from top to bottom, one line at a time.

---

# DIAGRAM
## Sequential Execution Flow
\`\`\`text
Line 1: print("Welcome")   ──> Prints "Welcome"
Line 2: print("Student")   ──> Prints "Student"
Line 3: print("Dashboard") ──> Prints "Dashboard"
\`\`\`

---

# INTERACTIVE PREDICT
## Predict the Order
Look at this code:
\`\`\`python
print("System Booting")
print("Welcome Mohit")
\`\`\`
Which message will the user see first in their terminal?
* Welcome Mohit
* System Booting
Correct: 2
Explanation: Python executes commands sequentially from top to bottom. It will print "System Booting" first, then "Welcome Mohit".

    duration: 12,
    type: 'markdown',
    content: `# CONCEPT EXPLANATION
## What is the Python Interpreter?
Computers cannot understand raw text like \`print()\`. They only understand binary numbers (ones and zeros).
Python uses a translation engine called the **Interpreter** to translate each line of your code into computer instructions *on the fly*, as it runs.

---

# REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
## The Real-time Translator
Think of a compiler like a book translator who translates a whole novel into Spanish before you read it.
The Python Interpreter is like a live translator standing next to a speaker, translating sentence-by-sentence in real time.

---

# COMMON BEGINNER ERRORS
## Halt on First Error
Since Python translates line-by-line, it will run all correct lines at the top of your file, but the moment it hits a line with a typo, it halts immediately.

---

# INTERACTIVE PREDICT
## Trace the Crash
If line 1 has correct code, but line 2 has a typo, what happens?
* The computer warns you but runs both lines anyway.
* Line 1 runs successfully, then the program halts with an error on line 2.
* The program does not run at all.
Correct: 2
Explanation: Python executes statements sequentially. It successfully prints line 1, then crashes immediately when translating line 2.

    duration: 15,
    type: 'markdown',
    content: `# CONCEPT EXPLANATION
## The System PATH
Before you can run Python, your computer needs to find where the Python execution program is saved. This is managed by a list of folder paths called the **PATH Variable**.

---

# COMMON BEGINNER ERRORS
## "Python is not recognized"
If you open a terminal and type \`python\` but see "Command not found" or "not recognized", it means the folder containing Python is not listed in your system's PATH.
*Tip: During installation, always check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".*

---

# TERMINAL RUN
## Verify environment
Command: python --version
Output:
Python 3.12.2
Verification Successful: Your operating system successfully located Python using the PATH variable.

    duration: 10,
    type: 'markdown',
    content: `# CONCEPT EXPLANATION
## Why use an Editor?
While you can write code in a basic text file, professional developers use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) because it highlights typos before we run the code.

---

# REFLECTION CARD
## Squiggly Red Lines
VS Code uses an extension called **Pylance**. Think of Pylance as a spellchecker for your code. If you make a typo, Pylance highlights it with a red squiggly line.

---

# BEST PRACTICES
## Open Folders, Not Files
Never open isolated single files in VS Code. Always open a full folder. This lets VS Code index your code files and help you navigate them easily.

    codeSnippet: `# Print the active status message below
print("STUDENT PORTAL ACTIVE")
`,
    expectedOutput: 'STUDENT PORTAL ACTIVE',
    content: `# CONCEPT EXPLANATION
## Standard Output print()
To display status messages on our Student Portal CLI, we use the \`print()\` function.
Characters must be enclosed inside matching quotes:
* Double quotes: \`print("STUDENT PORTAL ACTIVE")\`
* Single quotes: \`print('STUDENT PORTAL ACTIVE')\`

---

# COMMON BEGINNER ERRORS
## Quote Clashes
If you use single quotes inside a single-quoted print, Python gets confused:
* \`print('It's active')\` ──> Crash!
* \`print("It's active")\` ──> Safe! (Double quotes wrap the single quote).

---

# CHALLENGE CARD
## Boot the Portal
Modify the code on the right-side compiler panel to display this exact message:
\`STUDENT PORTAL ACTIVE\`
Then run the compiler.

    title: '6. Case Sensitivity Rules',
    duration: 12,
    type: 'markdown',
    content: `# CONCEPT EXPLANATION
## Case Matters
Python treats uppercase and lowercase letters as completely different characters. To Python, \`print\` and \`Print\` are not the same thing.

---

# COMMON BEGINNER ERRORS
## NameError typo
Since built-in commands are lowercase, typing \`Print("Hello")\` with a capital \`P\` will result in a \`NameError\` because \`Print\` does not exist in Python's memory.

---

# INTERACTIVE PREDICT
## Spot the Case Bug
Predict the result of running this code:
\`\`\`python
username = "Mohit"
print(Username)
\`\`\`
* It prints "Mohit".
* It crashes with a NameError because "Username" starts with a capital U.
Correct: 2
Explanation: Python is strictly case-sensitive. The variable was declared as lowercase \`username\`, so trying to fetch \`Username\` fails.

    duration: 15,
    type: 'markdown',
    content: `# CONCEPT EXPLANATION
## Writing for Humans
Code tells the computer *what* to do, but documentation tells other engineers *why* we did it.
* **Comments (#):** Python ignores anything written after a \`#\` symbol. Use comments to explain complex lines.
* **Docstrings ("""):** Triple-quoted blocks placed at the top of a file or function to document what the whole file does.

---

# BEST PRACTICES
## Clear Comments
Write comments that explain the reason, not just describe the obvious code.
* Bad: \`print(name) # Print name\`
* Good: \`# Print student name in upper case to match portal header\`

    title: '8. Spacing and Indentation',
    duration: 15,
    type: 'markdown',
    content: `# CONCEPT EXPLANATION
## Spacing is Structural
In other languages, developers use curly braces \`{}\` to group code blocks. Python does not use braces; it uses **blank spaces (indentation)**.
The official Python guide (called PEP 8) recommends using exactly **4 spaces** for each level of indentation.

---

# DIAGRAM
## Visualizing Indentation Levels
\`\`\`text
Global Scope (No Indentation)
└── if user_role == "student":
    └── print("Access Granted") (Indented 4 spaces)
\`\`\`

---

# COMMON BEGINNER ERRORS
## IndentationError
Adding an accidental space at the start of a normal line will trigger an \`IndentationError\` and prevent Python from running your code.

You have mastered the foundations of Python code execution and configured the basic terminal outputs for the Tech Tomorrow CLI.

# BEST PRACTICES
## Self-Check List
Review this checklist before starting the Checkpoint Assessment Gate:
1. Python translates line-by-line sequentially from top-to-bottom.
2. Capitalization matters: \`print\` is correct, \`Print\` crashes.
3. Spacing defines block structures. Mismatched spacing causes crashes.
